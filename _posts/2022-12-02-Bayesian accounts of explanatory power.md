### 1 Introductory remarks 

I follow Schupbach and Sprenger’s (Schupbach & Sprenger 2011) intriguing analysis where they forward a Bayesian probabilistic perspective to explanatory power (EP). Schupbach and Sprenger ( denoted as ‘S&S’ hereafter) contend that Peirce’s three-step inferential pattern of abductive reasoning (Peirce 1934) captures at least one familiar and intuitive sense in which we come to judge the EP that an explanans (‘H’) has over a given explanandum (‘E’). They adopt Pierce’s three-step inferential pattern (denoted as ‘PI’ hereafter) as their target notion of EP and raise an account that measures EP in terms of the degree to which H reduces the surprise in E, which they explicate as the increase in the degrees of belief ( subjective Bayesian belief) in E that H brings about. 

In this article I introduce explanatory reasoning and EP. I go on to discuss Peirce’s three step inferential pattern that captures an intuitive sense in which we can evaluate EP. Then I cover S&S’s proposal which offers a Bayesian approach to accounting EP in the context of PI.


### 1.1 Explanatory reasoning and explanatory power
Much of human reasoning is a product of evaluating explanations and making sense of things by seeking out explanations (Klahr & Masnick, 2002). This is true not only in our everyday practice of reasoning, but also in more formal settings like philosophy and science (Douven 2022; Douven & Mirabile, 2018;Koslowski et al., 2008; Koslowski, 2017). Lipton (Lipton 2003) captures the sense in which explanations guide our everyday reasoning with the following vignette, “Faced with tracks in the snow of a certain peculiar shape, I infer that a person on snowshoes has recently passed this way.” Lipton infers to “a person on snowshoes recently passed this way” (explanans ‘H’) since it provides the best explanation for the “tracks in snow”( explanandum ‘E”). The vignette also highlights the fact that explanatory reasoning is oftentimes a tacit and an unconscious epistemic practice, but when asked to make our mode of reasoning explicit, we typically find that it was an appeal to explanatory considerations that guided our inference (Douven 2022; Schurz 2008).

Philosophers generally agree that scientific inferential practice of past and present relies on explanatory patterns of argumentation (Lipton 2004; Thagard 1989; Okasha 2000).  Glymour (Glymour 1980) , when speaking of explanatory reasoning, writes, “One can find such arguments in sociology, in psychometrics, in chemistry and astronomy, in the time of Copernicus, and in the most recent of our scientific journals”. But regardless of whether in the scientific arena or as part of quotidian reasoning, what underwrites explanatory reasoning generally in its various uses and applications, is our evaluations of EP. 

The EP of an explanation or hypothesis is our measure or judgment of its strength or quality to explain an explanandum. It is the “explanatoriness” of the explanans (explanatory hypothesis) over the explanandum and subsequently how we come to rank or judge strong hypotheses from weak ones. We develop preferences among hypotheses based on our evaluations of their EP over the explanandum and find that a hypothesis provides sufficient explanation when we judge it to have high EP over the explanandum. 


### 1.2 The three-step inferential pattern of Peirce 
Peirce contends that the function of explanatory reasoning is in the generation of candidate hypotheses that are worthy of further assessment and calls this abduction (Peirce 1934). He formulates this as the following three-step inferential pattern (PI):

1)The surprising fact, E, is observed; 

2)But if H were true, E would be a matter of course, 

3)Hence, there is reason to suspect that H is true

Peirce takes the statement  “a matter of course” to indicate having a satisfactory explanation for the explanandum E (Frankfurt 1958;Douven 2022) and characterizes the EP of a hypothesis H over E as the ability of H to minimize the surprise in E and render E expected, by providing a satisfactory explanation for it.

Strictly speaking, Peirce contends that explanatory reasoning as expressed in PI, concludes in an “investigand mood” ( Ma and Pietarinen 2016), with candidate hypotheses that are worthy of further investigation and assessment. This can also be understood as guiding reasoning in the context of pursuit, since it motivates the decision to select and pursue certain hypotheses over others (Mirabile, P., & Lombrozo, T. 2019).


### 1.3 Schupbach & Sprenger’s account of explanatory power
S&S take PI to represent at least one familiar sense in which explanatory reasoning is commonly deployed and develop an account that is meant to capture EP in such PI instances of explanatory reasoning. 

Adopting and building on PI, S&S contend that the EP of a hypothesis ‘H’ over a surprising fact ‘E’ directly corresponds to the degree to which it makes E less surprising. A powerful explanation with a high measure of EP then corresponds to its ability in substantially lowering the surprise ( or substantially increasing the expectedness) in E. 

To formalize this, the key interpretative move that S&S make is to represent surprise (or  expectedness) in E,  in terms of probabilities and degrees of belief in E. S&S contend that this finds a natural connection to Bayesian approaches that advocate for propositional attitudes and beliefs in terms of degrees of beliefs, and belief states represented as probability distributions (Sprenger, & Hartmann, S. 2019 ). They take a surprising E to be low degrees of belief or low probability in E, where the degrees of belief in E (or the probability of E) is denoted by P(E). Following PI, they take the reduction of surprise in E that the explanatory hypothesis H brings about as the increases the degrees of belief in E given H. This is the probability of E given H and is denoted by ```P(E|H) ( the symbol ‘|’  indicates “given” or “conditional on”, and in the case of P(E|H), it denotes the probability of E given H were true).```

Given the foregoing, they take H to have EP over E and thereby making E less surprising in the inferential pattern of PI only when the inequality ```P(E) < P(E|H)``` is true. For S&S this inequality is the key idea behind their Bayesian probabilistic approach to measuring EP for instances of explanatory reasoning that are captured in PI. According to S&S, the inequality expresses the condition of PI that must be met if H were to have EP over E. This condition is satisfied when ```P(E|H)```, degrees of belief in E given H (probability of E given H) is greater than P(E), the earlier degrees of belief in E ( in step 1 of PI), that was unconditioned and without taking H into account. 

Based on this, S&S state the following to be the core condition for EP of H over E, within the inferential pattern of PI:

“(**Positive Relevance**): Ceteris paribus, the greater the degree of statistical relevance between e and h, the higher E(e, h)”

S&S denote this as the positive relevance condition ( ‘PR’ hereafter) and take the EP of H over E denoted by E(e, h), to be directly proportional to the strength of the inequality ```P(E) < P(E|H)```. They refer to the strength of the inequality ```P(E) < P(E|H)``` as the statistical relevance between E and H and enjoin that the degree to which H has EP over E is given by the increase in the degrees of belief in E that H brings about.

This concludes my introduction of S&S’s probabilistic approach to EP. I have more to say about their proposal [here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/epistemology/2022/12/02/Against-Schupbach-and-Sprenger-s-bayesian-account-of-explanatory-power.html){:target="_blank"}, where argue against their conception of EP.

I want to end this article by noting that EP has been of some interest to philosophers over the years ( Christensen 1999; Eells 1982; Good 1960;Glass 2007;Mcgrew 2003;Popper 1959) but S&S’s paper argues a new analysis of it and is considered a significant contribution to the topic. It has rekindled interest and spurred several publications which follow in the footsteps of S&S’s method and largely rely on their results (Cohen 2015; Crupi & Tentori 2012; Eva & Stern 2019; Glass 2018; Schupbach 2011; Schupbach 2017; Stroing 2018). For this reason, I have primarily focused on S&S’s approach as it stands to be the latest and, to my knowledge, the most favored account of EP presently.
