[Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/epistemology/2021/04/19/Hermeneutical-Injustice.html){:target="_blank"}, I summarized Fricker’s account of hermeneutical injustice and provided some theoretical grounding for some important terminology. In this section, I want to argue and account for cases where occluded experiences have been named and added to language, but are hindered in their circulation and promulgation within language. Insofar as they are persistently hindered, they may only find adoption in society’s collective hermeneutical resources and collective understanding after long periods of time have passed, since being named. Since the sensemaking term has been added to language, some individuals within society to whom it is available can make use of it.  But until that time when the term finds adoption in society’s collective understanding , hermeneutical injustice is not prevented. This presents an irregularity for Fricker’s account which formulates hermeneutical injustice in terms of hermeneutical gaps rendering experience equally unintelligible for everyone.

Medina has some similar points against Fricker. He contends subgroups come up with their own peculiar resources and idiosyncrasies to render intelligible their experience within their subgroups, and that there usually are “ inchoate” and “embryonic” understandings and attempts to communicate one's ‘occluded’ experience (Medina 2012). What I'm arguing for here is slightly different from Medina, wherein Medina’s sensemaking concepts are ‘inchoate’ and subgroups come up with their own ‘peculiar’, ‘idiosyncratic’ resources,  I will be arguing for conceptualized sensemaking terms that been added to society’s language and still hermeneutical injustice may persist.

### Hermeneutical Injustice

Just naming and induction of sensemaking terms ( of previously occluded experiences) into society’s language is not enough to stop hermeneutical injustice. Overcoming Hermeneutical injustice requires those sensemaking terms to also be inducted in the collective understanding. Insofar as overcoming hermeneutical injustice requires induction into collective understanding, it is consistent with Fricker’s definition. However Fricker seems to assume that naming and induction of a sensemaking term into language simply causes its induction into the collective understanding, or that the time that passes between induction into language (timeL) and induction into collective understanding (timeC) is trivial or negligible. However I contend induction into language does not simply mean induction into collective understanding and that the time that passes between the two events timeC-timeL is usually not trivial but prolonged.

The journey from induction into language (eventL) to  induction into collective understanding (eventC) entails circulation and promulgation of the term within society’s language. When this journey faces persistent interference and impedance, it may result in a prolonged passage of time between the two events. And so my claim is two-fold.

3) Unlike Fricker, I contend timeC-timeL is prolonged.
4) In this prolonged stretch of time, hermeneutical injustice continues to occur.

In the remainder of this paper I will attempt to 

5) Substantiate my claims 3) and 4) by utilizing several use cases.
6) By virtue of 5) I will provide some reasons for 3) and 4).
7) And in conclusion, show that my claims introduce some irregularities in Fricker’s account.
   
#### Not Gaps

Fricker makes the argument that gaps in our collective understanding give rise to hermeneutical injustice. However in many cases it appears to not be a gap, but existing sensemaking terms which misrepresent experience. Consider Fricker’s paradigmatic case of sexual harassment where “flirting” was used (Brownmiller 1990), and postpartum depression where “personal deficiency” was used (Fricker 2007, p. 149). The task to make experiences intelligible then has the additional burden of not just finding names and inducting them into language, but also overcoming the resistance of existing terms, to jettison and replace them in the collective.

Journey of a sensemaking term (termL), from eventL to eventC requires circulation and promulgation within language, whose only path to success (to collective understanding) is by means of its endorsement by en masse members in society. When in cases where members of society already endorse another competing sensemaking term (termC), termL faces the additional burden of having to convince these members of society to give up their previously held term and convince enough of them, such that the average user of that society’s language comes to now endorse termL. Only then can we say termL has been inducted into the collective understanding and has replaced termC.

#### Flawed Concepts

Where in 4.1 I discussed defeating and replacing an existing term in the collective understanding, here I want to talk about a pernicious variant of it . In this case the sensemaking term is appropriate, but the underlying sensemaking concept is flawed such that the sensemaking concept would render some instances of the experience intelligible, but not other instances. I will use the example of rape to elaborate.

Per Jenkins, incorrect beliefs about the term and concept of rape are pervasive in the UK. People believe that rape always involves physical force and always involves physically resisting the attacker (Jenkins 2016a). Flawed versions of the concept have also made it into UK’s legal system, assuming only penile penetration constitutes rape (Haenel 2018). Where the term ‘rape’ exists but underlying sensemaking concept of the term is flawed ( in collective understanding) , some women ( and men) may experience rape, but deploying the existing collectively understood concept of the term ‘rape’ will not yield the experience intelligible as rape. To contrast this case with 4.1 , in 4.1 the existing terms rendered no instance of the experience intelligible, and the term along with its sensemaking concept needed to be replaced. In the case of rape, many instances of the experince are rendered intelligible, but many may not. Here the term ‘rape’ does not need replacing but its underlying concept requires fixing. The undertaking on offer here is to take a corrected sensemaking concept (conceptM) of term (termC) and then while keeping termC , replace its underlying conceptC with conceptM, in the collective understanding. Such an endeavor will contain its own set of unique resistances while traversing from from eventL to eventC, due to its pernicious nature and legal bearing, along with the resistances dictated in 4.1 which are still valid here.

#### Testimonial Injustice 

I will again consider the case of sexual harassment here. Even in present day 2021, in many society’s, its an untenable position to argue that the sensemaking term of sexual harassment has been inducted into our collective understanding. There is still ongoing education about it, and we continue to hear the prevalence of sexual harassment and terms like “friendliness”, “complimenting”, “joking”, “fun work environment” to explain the experiences of it. The term “sexual harassment” made its public debut in 1975 when Farley testified to the Commission of Human Rights of New York City. That is to say , the term had officially entered language in 1975 , but has still not entered our collective understanding. And if we do want to argue for its present day induction into the collective understanding , can we say the same for the 2000’s (which would still be two decades after its public naming)?

In 4.1 I charted the resistance that the sensemaking term sexual harassment faces to get from eventL to eventC. I want to unpack that further and offer that undue credibility deficits from testimonial injustice may exacerbate matters and strengthen resistance to circulation and promulgation. Considering that to get from eventL to eventC requires circulation and promulgation within language, whose only path to success to entering the collective understanding is by means of its endorsement by en masse members of society, its endorsement would typically involve some sort of communicative gesture or testimony from women to men. But due to testimonial injustice women may sustain undue credibility deficits on their testimonies owing to identity prejudice and implicit bias (Fricker 2007, 28 ) . This will impart additional resistances to circulation and promulgation. ”Presents an obstacle to truth, either directly by causing the hearer to miss out on a particular truth, or indirectly by creating blockages in the circulation of critical ideas” and “Can prevent speakers from successfully putting knowledge into the public domain reveals testimonial injustice as a serious form of unfreedom in our collective speech” (2007, 43). Additionally the harms of sustaining testimonial injustice may include loss in confidence in one's belief and justification in what one is attempting to communicate , adding yet another layer of resistance. “may lose confidence in his belief, or in his justification for it” and “persistent testimonial injustice may lose confidence in her general intellectual abilities” (2007, 43)

#### Bubbles

In present day societies, the role of social media and search engines needs to be addressed as well. It's well established that social media creates filter bubbles and echo chambers ( Pariser, 2011). This tends to amplify and reinforce a selected set of thoughts and concepts where individuals might find themselves entrenched in subcultures of intellectual and ideological isolation. Search engines like Google will do something similar. In his paper, Pariser cites the example in which two people searching for “BP”  (British Petroleum) would receive different results,  one would see news related to investing in the company and the other would receive information about a recent oil spill. 

Insofar as how this affects an individual's psychology, according to Howard , social agents respond , organize and categorize information using psychological structures called schemas  ( Howard 2000). And schemas come in the form of social scripts and publicly shared categories that are internalized by members of that social group ( Sewell 1992). The social scripts that arise out of social media and search engines by virtue of filter bubbles have the potential to come out radicalized and individuals that subscribe to such radicalized social scripts will process information that is radically constrained by their schemas. For instance if an individual has the filter bubble engendered social script “that the term sexual harassment is a political fabrication and trying to make something out of nothing”, he may dismiss the term out of hand without it ever impinging on his reasoning faculties. Insofar as filter bubbles create ideological and intellectual isolation , it adds resistance to circulation and promulgation of sensemaking terms to reach eventC.”Democracy requires citizens to see things from one another’s point of view, but instead we’re more and more enclosed in our own bubbles. Democracy requires a reliance on shared facts; instead we’re being offered parallel but separate universes” (Pariser 2011).

#### Blindness

Here I want to consider ‘blindness’ to race and gender in a racialized and genderized society.
Such a blindness may be implicit when we don't consider race and gender as a factor in our epistemic endeavors like knowledge and understanding. However owing to structural identity prejudice and hermeneutical marginalization, generation of sensemaking terms and their  contribution to the collective understanding are heavily skewed towards the privileged. Places of employment  (academia, law, journalism, politics) which shape the collective understanding are largely out of reach to members of prejudiced social groups. Furthermore blindness may take an explicit form, where privileged members explicitly take the seemingly virtuous commitment to not see gender, or race in others (Medina 2012). Blindness may also take an explicit form when one explicitly discounts race/gender out of one’s epistemic calculus. Dotson contends in her paper ‘Accumulating Epistemic Power’ that “problems with epistemology can emerge in the face of oppressive structural problems” and “problematic epistemic conduct” occurs when taking a “race neutral” stance (Dotson 2018).  In that,  by virtue of blindness ( implicit or explicit) one takes the position where one ignores the fact that prejudiced social groups are largely excluded from shaping collective understanding ( Fricker 2007, 153). Ignores that this results in a collective understanding that is discriminatory to them. And in effect, actively seeks to normalize one’s sensemaking terms. That which renders intelligible the experiences of the privilege are actively used to render intelligible experiences for the rest. In conclusion normalizing involves actively fitting one's own sensemaking terms onto others and actively suppressing alternative sensemaking terms that would accurately explain the social reality of other. And insofar as ‘blindness’ may cause this , it acts as another layer of resistance for sensemaking terms to get to eventC.

### Conclusion

In section 4, I argued for the prolonged time that sensemaking terms may incur to get from eventL to eventC, i.e from naming and induction into language to induction into the collective understanding. I did this utilizing several use cases which show the mounting resistance sensemaking terms face in getting to eventC. The conclusion I want to draw from these use cases is that there is resistance in getting to eventC , and that resistance can be persistent, substantial, and manifold , ultimately yielding a substantial period of between timeL to timeC, during which hermeneutical injustice continues to occur. Insofar as my argument makes the case that hermeneutical  injustice continues to occur until the time eventC obtains, i.e the sensemaking term gets inducted into the collective understanding, it is in line with Fricker’s definition “..obscured from collective understanding..”. However if my argument is convincing, we find ourselves with the following irregularities in Fricker account.

Fricker assumes hermeneutical injustice to be a purely structural issue, but I have shown that resistance in getting to eventC may be mounted by individuals ( at least in cases 4.,3 and 4.5). Insofar as hermeneutical  injustice continues to occur after eventL and prior to eventC, hermeneutical injustice is not purely structural, as resistance can be agent inculpate.
Fricker contends there are gaps in the collective hermeneutical resources which need to be filled , I contend that it's not always just a gap , but an existing term that needs to be replaced. Fricker assumes the gap is equally present for everyone, but if my accounting has been correct, then that is not the case, since in the journey from eventL to eventC, we will find many individuals in society for whom the sensemaking term is available to render their experience intelligible.
