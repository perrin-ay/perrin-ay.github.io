[In part 1](https://perrin-ay.github.io/ethics/mind/epistemology/2019/10/19/The-complicated-nature-of-doxastic-wrongs.html){:target="_blank"}, using intuition pumps of sketches and vignettes , i tried to conceive the idea of how wronging others may happen simply in viture of belief. Here i further dig into how wronging may track on beliefs.

Eliminativist (Churchland 1979, Churchland 1981) and realist ( Fodor 1975) literature takes  propositional attitudes exclusively as the mental states being attributed when one engages in FP. By propositional attitudes we mean an attitude such as belief or desire towards a proposition. But, while the practice of FP describes the underlying mental causes of our behavior in terms of propositional attitudes, the eliminative materialist (Churchland 1981) wants to deny the very existence of these terms. 

In this entry Il try to show how the eliminativists proposal (that the terms of folk psychology are irreducible in the framework of neuroscience),  hinges on their argument conferring a theory status to FP. But if the regulative view of FP (McGeer 2015) is true, FP is not a theory and the eliminativist argument has chosen a false premise. [In this post](https://perrin-ay.github.io/mind/2021/09/01/Intro-to-eliminative-materialism.html){:target="_blank"} I had introduced the eliminative materialists position. Below I further explore why the eliminativist assumes the theory view of FP and in later sections of this post I formulate and explain the regulative view which rejects the theory status of FP, along with some use cases in favor of it.

### Folk psychology (FP) as a theory

Eliminative materialists (EM) like Churchland argue for the theory status of FP, by citing its strengths in explaining and predicting phenomena (human behavior), and features that are salient to empirical theories and characterize any scientific theory. Churchland’s approach here is one of framing a desiderata that any empirical theory ought to fulfill and then claiming any that satisfies the desiderata qualifies them to be an empirical theory. Below I have formulated what Churchland takes to be the four desiderata that qualifies an empirical theory (ibid.):

1. Provide predictions
   
2. Provide explanations
   
3. Provide meaning to theoretical terms introduced by the theory
   
4. Bring about unifying organization to phenomenon 

In Churchland 1981, he presents the case that FP successfully explains and predicts the behaviour of others; brings unifying organization to major topics in the philosophy of mind like other minds, introspection etc; introduces theoretical terms such as belief , desire and other propositional attitudes and gives them meaning in terms of causal functional roles, which he  takes to be constituted by a network of laws, and over which we have tacit command.
  
Thereby, he concludes that FP satisfies all four desiderata of an empirical theory, and  therefore it is an empirical theory.

As argued in section 2, his EM view requires that FP be a theory. However, there is an alternative view, mostly forwarded by McGeer (2007) and Zawidzki ( 2013) that rejects the theory view of FP (I will refer to Churchlands theory view of FP as TV going forward). In the next section I will discuss McGeer’s Regulative View (RV) and why it doesn't take FP to be a theory based practice.

### Regulative view of Folk Psychology

The formulation of RV goes like this (McGeer 2015) :

1. FP primarily involves the mind’s capacity to regulate and thereby shape one's thoughts, attitudes and actions (mind-making) in accordance with socially shared sensemaking norms. In developing this capacity, one develops FP know-how.
   
2. Then a competent folk psychologist is one whose FP know-how has been sufficiently developed such that her thoughts and actions are directly explicable in terms of the socially shared sense-making norms.

From #1 , McGeer wants to assert that FP is essentially a mind-making enterprise. Developing this mind-making capacity in ways commensurate to socially and largely shared norms involves practice and engagement with these norms. This is why in RV,  FP is taken to be a socially shared interpersonal engagement. 

Since ‘know-how’ comes in degrees, the more one practices and engages with socially shared norms , the more one models their thoughts in relation to these norms and the more one develops their FP know-how. Since we are by-and-large social beings, this interpersonal engagement and practice with socially shared norms comes naturally to us. And so when in the company of fellow agents with developed FP know-how, all of whom regulating their thoughts in accordance with socially shared and recognizable norms, every member of this company is then epistemically empowered in explaining and predicting each other's behavior in relation to the common and shared norms that shapes their collective minds. McGeer calls this the “practice-dependent epistemic gain”.

In conclusion, RV’s conceptualization of FP leaves no room for the individualist theorizing of underlying mental states to explain behavior. Or that of leveraging ( albeit tacitly) an empirical theory to discover and detect mental states in others. Per RV, epistemic gains in explaining and predicting others actions are afforded by regulating and modeling one's own thinking in relation to socially shared norms, and this can only happen with practice and social engagement with those norms. Therefore, if RV is correct, then FP is not an empirical theory.

There are exceptions to the success of FP, some everyday situations where FP typically fails. I will consider some of these cases in the next section and show that they track exceptionally well under RV, but not TV.  

#### Use cases

**Alien culture**: Consider agent C from culture Cc and another agent D from culture Cd where Cd is quite alien to Cc. Now grounded in our everyday experience is the phenomenon where we will find that C often struggles to make sense of the thoughts and actions of  D and vice versa. Per RV, this is easily explained by the fact that C, while competent in cultural norms of Cc, is not competent and has not developed her capacity to regulate her thoughts and actions per cultural norms of Cd. And the same is true for D. With the effect, they both struggle to explain/predict each other's thoughts and actions.  Also found in everyday experience, as C starts to spend time with Cd people and engages with the social norms of that culture, she starts to make better sense of Cd people’s actions and this ability only gets better as enculturation continues. RV predicts this as well since enculturation would involve engaging and developing one mental capacity per norms of Cd and then benefitting from practice-dependent epistemic gains as mentioned the regulative view by McGeer.

To explain this, proponents of TV might say that its view entails a family of theories and the theory that underpins C’s explanation of behavior is different from D’s (Stitch 1983). Firstly, this response looks ad hoc by appealing to different theories and a family of theories without providing any real accounting for this. Secondly, TV claims FP to be a quasi-scientific theory and in its account offers no explanation as to why different cultures would inhabit different quasi-scientific theories of FP. Additionally, it does not address why FP would only improve with enculturation in this case. 

**Autism**: Autistic individuals have been noted to have impaired FP ability- they have trouble attributing mental states to others. But it has been observed that neurotypicals with developed ability to folk-psychologize also have trouble making sense of the thoughts and actions of autistic individuals (McGeer 2001, 2015). Under TV, there is no explanation forthcoming as to why a skilled folk psychology theoristic is simply unable to theorize about the underlying mental causes of behavior in another individual (albeit autistic). RV however, can easily explain this on the grounds of its practice-dependent epistemic gain feature. Practice-dependent epistemic gains are essentially reciprocal and per RV, one is only epistemically empowered to explain and predict the thoughts and actions of other minds that have been similarly shaped by common and socially shared norms. However, when other minds are non-conforming to these norms , the epistemic gains will also diminish or  unavailable altogether. Per RV, autistic individuals have impared FP capacity since their thoughts and actions are not regulated or shaped in accordance with social norms, and so their minds are non-conformist to these norms. But since epistemic gain essentially relies on conformity, the gains are unavailable for competent folk psychologists as well when it comes to predicting and explaining the minds of autistic individuals. 

**Hermeneutical injustice**: In a racialized society, hermeneutical marginalization renders the collective hermeneutical resources to be prejudiced and discriminatory (Fricker 2007). To clarify some terminology first,  the collective hermeneutical resources are nothing but the socially shared sense-making concepts and norms on which society's members rely for their social and epistemological dispositions. Hermeneutical marginalization occurs when there is unequal participation and contribution in the generation of society’s sensemaking terms and norms on account of structural identity prejudice (as in the case of racialized society), which results in the socially shared sensemaking norms that are representative only of experiences, thoughts and actions of the dominant social group.

Hermeneutical injustice occurs when one cannot render comprehensible to others ( and sometimes even to oneself ) one’e thoughts and action owing to hermeneutical marginalisation. RV comports well with the philosophical problem of hermeneutical injustice and provides a clear explanation on the incomprehensibility in terms of absent norms and gaps in the collective hermeneutical resources (socially shared sensemaking norms). Owing to hermeneutical marginalization ,sensemaking norms that would make the marginalised social groups experiences intelligible, are not made available in the collective hermeneutical resource pool and the shaping of minds that occurs in accordance to the collective hermeneutical pool results in diminished epistemic gains when it comes to making sense of the marginalised social group’s thoughts and actions.  Furthermore, as is the case in racialised societies, hermeneutical injustice persists for long periods of time, since the sensemaking norms of the marginalised continue to remain absent from the collective hermeneutical resources. 

Here too we find TV does not comport well with hermeneutical injustice , as discussed earlier in the culture section , it's not clear why and how theories would be different between social groups within the same culture and society. Furthermore TV fails to explain why this issue persists, why TV simply can't start using the correct theory to render marginalised groups thoughts and actions intelligible. 

### Concluding Remarks

RV is a promising account, capable of explaining some everyday situations of FP  failures, which TV does not.  Additionally, it comports well with the philosophical problem of hermeneutical injustice. I want to propose this makes a stronger case for RV as the true account. But since RV does not take FP to be a theory, RV also makes a case against the EM argument which takes TV as a premise. And if RV is correct, then it proves fatal to the EM claims of propositional attitude not reducible in the framework of neuroscience.
