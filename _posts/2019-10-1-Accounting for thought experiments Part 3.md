[In part 1](https://perrin-ay.github.io/thought-experiments/2019/09/12/Accounting-for-thought-experiments.html){:target="_blank"}, I introduced thought experiments , what they are , their usefulness to philosophers, their phenomenonal character and how philosophical thought experiments might differ from scientific ones.

[In part 2](https://perrin-ay.github.io/thought-experiments/2019/09/21/Accounting-for-thought-experiments-Part2.html){:target="_blank"}, I offered the Nortons and Browns account of TE, both of which are unsatifactory. 

Here I offer an account of my own

### A Better Account of Thought Experiments ?

It is noteworthy that most existing accounts of thought experiments ( Norton 1996 , Brown 1991, and Kuhn 1981) are primarily focused on providing answers to the epistemological problem of thought experiments -”Thought experiments are supposed to give us information about our physical world. From where can this information come?” (Norton 1996). By doing so these views fall short on proper accounting of other salient aspects of thought experiments, resulting in incomplete and at times erroneous considerations.

Contemplation of imaginary scenarios is salient to conducting thought experiments, and evocation of mental imagery is occurrent whether the thought experiment can later be reconstructed into an argument successfully or not. David Hume understood ideas to be impressions reproduced in the mind. He noted impressions to be imagistic, and concluded ideas and thoughts to be imagistic too.( Hume, Oxford Clarendon edition 1978). Besides philosophical writings on mental imagery, there is considerable experimental data for it in cognitive science and psychology ( Kosslyn 1975, Kosslyn et al. 1978, Shepard and Metzler 1971, and Finke 1980). These studies show functionally and operationally mental imagery works analogous to visual sense perception - “functional-equivalence hypothesis”. Far off objects appear fuzzy, lacking detail in visual perception, this is reproduced by manipulating and adjusting  mental imagery of the same target object ( Kosslyn 1975). Visual perception of scanning a large map from one point to another is reproduced by manipulating the mental image of the map to create similar scanning operation from one point to another. Furthermore, cognitive psychology studies shows performance in inferential problems was found to depend on ease of making mental and visual imagery of those problems (Shaver et al. 1975 and Clement and Falmagne 1986). 

In this section I offer an account of thought experiments that does not ignore the mental imagery aspect of conducting a thought experiment ,its belief forming property,  and thought experiments that have no argumentational form. Mental imagery is found to be functionally and operationally akin to visual perception, and manipulation of mental imagery would then be akin to making varied observations via sense perception ie. looking at different things. This amounts to sort of quasi-observational account rather than a view of explicit inference from propositional logic, to forming new beliefs in the course of a thought experiment. Gendler believes thought experiments are purely quasi-observational belief forming mechanism (Gendler 2004). However, I don’t rule out Norton’s point of rearranging and generalizing older beliefs to form new ones as a step to epistemic gain. While there is manipulation of mental imagery to precipitate a quasi-observational occurrence, unlike actual visual sense perception, there is no real object in the world being viewed to learn from. It is the underlying cognitive inferential mechanism that offers up intuitions from personal experience and background knowledge to modify, adjust and form quasi-observations. The visual strength of the thought experiment determines the feeling and conduct of the thought experiment. When the thought experiment is vivid , particularly imaginative and heavy with narrative elements, the conduct and epistemic gains is dictated by the quasi-observations. When the thought experiment is less vivid and less conducive to imagination , the underlying inferential process comes to bear in the conduct of the thought experiments- it is less quasi-observational, and with elements of logical inferences clearly felt by reasoners. In cases of more complex thought experiments where counter-intuitive beliefs are provoked( Chalmer’s Zombies) or an edifice of beliefs is engendered( Abbott and Poincare’s Flatland) ,where there is not much to the imaginative character of the thought experiment to begin with or is at best intermittent and not sustained through course of conduct, the inferential process comes to bear substantially on the thought experimenter. In all cases where inferential process comes to bear, inferential reasoning could involve intuitions, hidden premises from background knowledge which do not explicitly activate during the course of the thought experiment or explicit argument formulation to move the thought experiment forward.The easy, and quick nature of thought experiments is obtained when quasi-observational ( previously cited Shaver et al. 1975 study)  or intuition based reasoning modes are engaged.

Taking the tripartite definition of knowledge, epistemic gains or knowledge acquired from thought experiments needs to be justified. While an appeal to realiablism can be made to quasi-observational and inferential components described earlier, the fact is thought experiments often lead to fallacious conclusions. Reconstructing thought experiment into arguments( those that can be reconstructed) thereby making explicit all premises and propositions to check for false assumptions, vague or underdetermined premises and fallacious inferences is necessary to determine whether the thought experiment outcome is a valid one. On this point I also agree with Norton.
