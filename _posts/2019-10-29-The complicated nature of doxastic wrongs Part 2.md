[In part 1](https://perrin-ay.github.io/ethics/mind/epistemology/2019/10/19/The-complicated-nature-of-doxastic-wrongs.html){:target="_blank"}, using intuition pumps of sketches and vignettes , i tried to conceive the idea of how wronging others may happen simply in viture of belief. Here i further dig into how wronging may track on beliefs.

### Wronging Tracks on Belief

Even in weaker interpersonal relationships, people hold an interest in what others think of them. Take the following sketch: Amit is expecting delivery, and catches a glimpse of the delivery man approaching and notices he is Indian. As Amit gets up to receive the delivery, he decides the delivery man probably smells like curry. The doxastic attitude Amit holds of the delivery man is steeped in negative stereotypes. Applying stereotypes can be analogous to applying statistical based justification for believing something about an individual - for example women are less ambitious and competitive in the workplace. The wronging that is felt from such beliefs stems from the adopted presumptive stance. This presumptive stance goes on to impute certain properties usually of negative valence onto the other, and this attempts to take away and reduce the other’s personhood, pro-tanto reducing the other's agency. But this is not how we view ourselves and it falls short of how we expect others to view us in their beliefs . 

Similar explanations could be found for doxastic wronging even when stereotypes (or statistical justifications) engendered beliefs turn out to be true. The belief itself was still based on a reference class of the belief holders choosing - usually race or gender, thereby in violation of the target individual's personhood and autonomy. The sense of wronging then tracks on the belief itself and what matters is the belief and how that doxastic attitude came to be( in this case from the stereotype). This underlies previous sketches as well. In any relationship, our identity (in others minds) is nothing but beliefs they hold of us. Actions reveal antecedent beliefs and when those beliefs don't fit our expectations, our sense of agency and autonomy, one incriminates the beliefs ( rather than or in addition to actions). Tracking wronging on belief and not just how we act also explains why positive property attribution of a stereotype is problematic. Deciding a person is probably a good cook based on the fact that she is a woman, could beget feelings of wronging as the belief makes less of the other’s autonomy and agency and holds her as a mere member of a stereotype.

#### Mindreading

Much work of doxastic wronging theorists typically focuses on the content of belief, its formation and the expectations we set of others on how we feature in their beliefs. But what remains unstated is how we come to relate and grasp others beliefs about us. This is a relevant aspect of wronging, at least when discussing whether there are such things as wronging by belief. In philosophy of mind , “theory of mind” or “mindreading” is understood as the capacity to represent and reason about others mental states.This capacity is crucial in interaction with others, as our ability to understand and coordinate with others depends on grasping their mental states. Mindreading might allow us to pick up on mental states of others, even when their actions or behavior to our face are not an outright enactment of their beliefs (Gordon 1986). And in the absence of inculpate actions, one might still discerns others thoughts and beliefs and be wronged by them. 

Simulation Theory ( ST) is one account of mindreading that theorizes mental simulation at its core and that we arrive at representing others mental states by simulating their mental states in our minds (Goldman 2006). Since one adopts someone else's point of view in one's own imagination, it makes our belief, of what others believe of us, prone to egocentric errors (Goldman 2006). Such errors can manifest in interesting ways. We might falsely represent others beliefs about us and be hurt by them. This would amount to doxastic wronging where the belief we attribute to the other is the belief we undergo while simulating ourselves in the others situation, rather than the actual beliefs held by the other in that situation. Egocentric errors in mindreading might also explain why arguing by way of narrative examples (as used in this paper) to draw out intuitions does not work for all readers with egocentric errors in simulation getting in the way. It might also be why people sometimes have trouble intuitively recognizing that holding certain beliefs of others wrongs them since their egocentric simulation might report no wronging.

### Challenge From Control

A challenge to doxastic wronging comes from the assumption that belief only follows the evidence and cannot really choose what to believe. That one lacks voluntary control over beliefs regarding propositions once presented with the evidence for it. Such doxastic involuntarism would then exculpate one's wrongs by belief since one has no control over them, and they just sort of naturally arise from evidence (Alston 1988). To rephrase this challenge to doxastic wronging, the assertion is one can only wrong another ( by belief or action) if one could have chosen to do (chosen to believe or act) otherwise. 

Consider the case of Charles Whitman who lethally harmed others after growth of a brain tumor. The brain tumor was revealed to be pressing against his amygdala , region of the brain vital to emotional and behavior control. Neuroscientists are of the view that in such cases previously normal patients can exhibit criminal behavior ( Darby et al 2018). From tumors or brain lesions one can lose control and could not have done otherwise. But would one not feel wronged by someone like Mr. Whitman who had lost control and could not have done otherwise ? Feeling wronged and the emotional and cognitive states associated with it do not seem to suspend when we know the wrongdoer could not have done otherwise. It still feels unfair, and evokes anger and resentment and we might still want to receive an apology or some sort of redress. If a tornado demolishes your home, one might still feel angry and robbed by nature who could not have done otherwise. The sense of having been wronged is palpable,  and your friends and family recognize this as well and offer their apologies, and the government might recompense you for the loss incurred4. As discussed in the previous section, a plausible explanation for reactive attitudes in such cases comes from “theory of mind”. We can't help but attribute minds to things and we adopt an intentional stance towards things, treating them as if they were rational agents (Denett 1971). The underlying claim to the problem that control poses for doxastic wronging is one that is levelled to wronging in general. And here I have argued that even accepting the assumptions of no control, when people or things could not have done otherwise, reactive attitudes that characterize wronging are still felt. 

Take the following sketch of a hit and run cab at night. Two services operate in the area- the Green and the Blue cab, but there is a single witness who identifies it as the Blue cab. Does one believe it was the Blue cab ? One might be inclined to believe it was the Blue cab since there is testimony as evidence for it. But suppose one recognizes individualized evidence is not perfectly reliable and probabilifies the outcome. So one might come to hold a qualified belief. Suppose one is statistically inclined and so decides to withhold judgment upon uncovering Green cab 85% base rate on any given night. Suppose one simply does not care and holds no doxastic attitude. Suppose one overhears the base rates conversation, but since they do not grasp what it means, they believe it was the Blue cab from testimony. 

So it would seem while belief supervenes on evidence, there is some cognitive space between doxastic attitudes and evidence. And that a personal element asserts itself in this cognitive space leading to different doxastic attitudes when presented with the same evidence5. It accounts for how we subjectively respond to the evidence based on our interests, motivations, background knowledge and stakes involved, all of which then dictates our epistemic inquiries where we ask questions of the evidence. Collectively this constitutes our epistemic reasons which is the lens through which we look at evidence, prior to taking any doxastic attitude from it. The proponents of involuntary belief from evidence pack too much in their claim. When we unpack it, we find that the claim subsumes the intellectual cognitive space of epistemic reasons. And these epistemic reasons might be enough to exert some control over beliefs in a meaningful way.

Epistemic reasons which support positive evaluation of evidence and positive epistemic status could be nurtured as epistemic virtues6. For example open-mindedness and intellectual humility have been accounted to contribute to positive evaluation of evidence. And so by developing positive epistemic reasons as epistemic virtues or skills one exerts some control over one's doxastic attitudes.
