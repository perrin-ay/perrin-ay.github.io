### Folk psychology introduction

Folk psychology (FP) refers to our everyday practice of attributing mental states to others ( and ourselves) in order to explain, and predict their behavior ( and make sense of our own). For instance, having witnessed a coworker looking for some creamer in the wrong cupboard, one might explain her behavior by attributing to her the false belief of the creamer located in that cupboard.

Eliminativist (Churchland 1979, Churchland 1981) and realist ( Fodor 1975) literature takes  propositional attitudes exclusively as the mental states being attributed when one engages in FP. By propositional attitudes we mean an attitude such as belief or desire towards a proposition. But, while the practice of FP describes the underlying mental causes of our behavior in terms of propositional attitudes, the eliminative materialist (Churchland 1981) wants to deny the very existence of these terms. 

### Eliminative materialism

The Eliminative Materialism (EM) thesis contends that there are no propositional attitudes such as belief and desires because neuroscience cannot accommodate them. And since FP relies on propositional attitudes for everyday explanation/prediction of behavior, it has to be “fundamentally defective in principles and ontology and will eventually be eliminated” with completed neuroscience (Churchland 1981).

Churchland’s EM argument (ibid.) can be formulated as follows:

1. FP is an empirical theory.
   
2. As a theory, its validity must be assessed the same as any other empirical theory.
   
3. But performing #2, shows several problems with FP,
   
3.1 A stagnant research program for the last millenia.
3.2 Limited explanatory scope. 
3.3 It appears incompatible to current principles of neuroscience and does not comport well with other related scientific fields working in an overlapping capacity to FP in explaining behavior.
   
4. Any theory suffering from #3 casts serious doubts to the veridicality of its theoretical entities (propositional attitudes in the case of FP) and thus in the case of FP, casts serious doubts on it being reducible to neuroscience.
 
”A successful reduction cannot be ruled out, in my view, but FP's explanatory impotence and long stagnation inspire little faith that its categories will find them- selves neatly reflected in the framework of neuroscience” (ibid.)

5. From #4 , FP is too defective to win survival through intertheoretic reduction to neuroscience.
    
6. Any theory of mind that is deemed irreducible to neuroscience should be eliminated.
    
7. From #5 and #6 , since FP is irreducible to neuroscience, it should be eliminated. 

In this formulation, Churchland’s EM claim that terms of FP do not refer, hinges on #1, the premise that FP is a theory. Starting with this premise, he goes on to conclude that FP is irreducible to neuroscience in #5. Then combined with premise #6, he concludes FP should be eliminated. But conclusion in #5 is only reached if #2 , #3 and #4 are satisfied. But if FP is not a theory, then #2, #3 and #4 are not applicable. So why does Churchland take FP to be a theory ? [Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/mind/2021/09/15/Folk-psychology-vs-Eliminative-Materialism.html){:target="_blank"}I consider his proposal for conferring the theory status to FP.
