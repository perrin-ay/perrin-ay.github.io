Fricker defines hermeneutical injustice to be the injustice of having some significant area of one's social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to hermeneutical marginalization( Fricker 2007, 154). 
She contends the obscuration occurs from a gap in society’s collective hermeneutical resources (2007, 150–151). And emphasizes hermeneutical injustice to be a purely structural notion (2007, 159-160), where society’s collective hermeneutical resources and its gaps impinge equally on all members of society, and those social experiences owing to hermeneutical gaps, will be rendered unintelligible for all members.

### Fricker’s Account of Hermeneutical Injustice 

Individual ‘A’ of social group ‘SG’ in society ‘S’ suffers hermeneutical injustice iff :

1) ‘A’ fails to properly understand a significant social experience ‘E’ and is unable to render it communicatively intelligible to others in ‘S’.

2) condition (1) is true because hermeneutical marginalization renders the collective hermeneutical resources structurally prejudiced and discriminatory against ‘SG’, creating gaps in the collective hermeneutical resources where the name ‘E’ should have been

The “gap” in condition (2) is not a gap simpliciter. Fricker states the necessary condition for hermeneutical injustice is for the gap to have resulted from hermeneutical marginalization, which is the unequal hermeneutical participation of certain social groups, resulting from - identity, socio-economic and class prejudice, and resulting in- subordination and exclusion of members of prejudiced these social groups from contributing to society’s collective hermeneutical resources.This renders the society’s collective hermeneutical resources itself to be structurally prejudiced, in that those resources tend to become biased and discriminatory  (Fricker 2007 p. 153-155).

The primary epistemic wrongs that obtain in hermeneutical injustice are the inability of subjects to render a significant social experience intelligible to self or others, and their prejudicial exclusion from contributing sensemaking terms to society's collective hermeneutical resources.

### Hermeneutical Resources

‘Hermeneutical resources ’ are central to the thesis of hermeneutical injustice. Fricker introduces them as ‘interpretative resources’ and explains them via examples and intuition pumps - Carmita wood case of sexual harassment (2007, 149), Wendy Sanford case of postpartum depression ( 2007, 150), but does not offer any theoretical clarifications. I will clarify here what I take these terms to mean in the spirit of what I take Fricker to mean by these terms.

1) ‘Hermeneutical resources’  are interpretative resources. I take these to be sensemaking terms with underlying sensemaking conceptual resources.
   
2) ‘Collective hermeneutical resources’ are society’s sensemaking terms wherein an average user of that society’s language is familiar with that term, and ‘collective understanding’ to be society’s understanding wherein an average user of that society’s language endorses that sensemaking term and its underlying sensemaking concept.

Generally speaking ‘concepts’ mean clusters of beliefs, and ‘beliefs’ themselves are a collection of other concepts (Margolis & Laurence 1999). I take ‘unable to render an experience intelligible’ to mean unable to gain a proper understanding of that experience. ‘Understanding’ is typically taken to be an internalist epistemic good (Pritchard 2014) and entails:

a) it is not opaque to one that one has this understanding.

b) one has good reflectively accessible reasons which can be cited in support of what one understands to be the case (where reasons are justificatory background beliefs).

In other words, per (a) and (b), understanding a thing makes that thing intelligible to oneself and one makes that thing intelligible to others by citing and making reasons explicit. And so in understanding something,  one ‘deploys’ concepts. And one may cite these concepts in support of what one understands to be the case. By ‘deploy’ concepts, I mean to bring into action and utilize concepts, and in “understanding”, one does that with concepts one is familiar with and also endorse as reasons.

In the context of hermeneutics of experience, understanding social experience (rendering experience intelligible) would then mean to deploy sensemaking concepts (hermeneutical resources). 

And in the case of an average user of that society’s language, to understand a social experience would mean to deploy sensemaking concepts that are in the collective hermeneutical resources and that are also part of the collective understanding ( per my usage of ‘deploy’ and (2))
