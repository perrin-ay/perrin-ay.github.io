Fricker defines hermeneutical injustice to be the injustice of having some significant area of one's social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to hermeneutical marginalization( Fricker 2007, 154). 
She contends the obscuration occurs from a gap in society’s collective hermeneutical resources (2007, 150–151). And emphasizes hermeneutical injustice to be a purely structural notion (2007, 159-160), where society’s collective hermeneutical resources and its gaps impinge equally on all members of society, and those social experiences owing to hermeneutical gaps, will be rendered unintelligible for all members.
