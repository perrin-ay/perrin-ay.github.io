## The Knowledge Account

The knowledge account (KNA) is largely attributed to Williamson (Williamson 1996, 2000). His formulation goes like this - Assert p iff one knows that p. Per KNA, asserters represent themselves as having knowledge, and are to be rightfully criticized when they fail at it. 

Assertions are a type of speech act (Searle 1969) and KNA recognizes that norms which apply to the speech acts in general, like norms of etiquette , politeness and so on, also apply to assertions (and decide on their propriety), but what is specific to assertions is the knowledge norm. This explains some counterexamples that may arise for the knowledge norm, consider Williamsons example where one has only moments to catch the train and so it’s appropriate to assert “That is your train!” without knowing ( but still having good reasons), thereby demonstrating that practical concerns and norms may overrule KNA, when in conflict with it. But with saying that only the knowledge norm is specific to assertions, KNA implies if not for practical circumstances that warrant urgency (like in the train example) and in the absence of all other non-epistemic factors that might play into the general norms of speech acts, the active norm is one that is specific to assertions, which being KNA per its defenders, would have deemed the train assertion improper as seems intuitively correct.

Counterexamples taking the forms of Gettierized beliefs and justifiably believed falsehoods are some of the standard objections raised against KNA. In either form one does not have knowledge and KNA would deem assertions of such beliefs inappropriate. But there is an intuitive sense that asserters of justified beliefs (whether ultimately false or true as a matter of luck) are not to be criticized for asserting those beliefs. Defenders of KNA explain this by appealing to a secondary fulfillment of the knowledge norm, where an asserter with justified belief that p, believes himself to be knowing that p, and thereby compliant of the KNA in a secondary sense. 

### Objections to the Knowledge Account

**Overruling Norms**: Typically, overruling norms as described in the previous section, are borne out of practical concerns - urgency for instance in the train example. Lackey’s selfless asserters (Lackey 2007) are another set of much discussed counterexamples where overruling norms of  professional context and responsibility are used to explain the violation of KNA (knowledge requires belief and Lackey’s Distraught Doctor does not believe what she asserts) while still finding the assertion appropriate and tracking on good reasons ( evidence backed by science in the case of the distraught doctor). 

But there is a sense in which ordinary speakers often find themselves in situations where their actions including speech acts like assertion are impinged upon by practical factors (Dewey 1999). In fact, practical concerns could even be appealed to as the dominant standard that dictates one’s actions in the moment, then prima facie more-often-than-not, KNA will find itself overruled by pragmatic norms. Similarly, ordinary speakers more-often-than-not operate within their professional contexts (given that one tends to spend at least half of one’s waking hours at work).

It appears in endorsing overruling norm maneuvers, the defenders of KNA are left with a weakened endorsement of knowledge which prima facie does not govern norms of assertions all that often. If overruling maneuver is to be taken seriously, it would appear KNA abdicates more-often-than-not to other norms. This weakens the claim of KNA which purports itself to be essential and necessary to assertions.

**Secondary propriety**: From an epistemological perspective, knowledge is hard to come by and conditions for it are stringent. Though there might be a consensus on some necessary conditions for knowledge, there is no consensus on necessary and sufficient conditions. For ordinary speakers, self-ascription of knowledge, might only amount to “bad knowledge” (Greenough 2011), from inability to, think of and corral and then rule out all relevant error possibilities. And there is the further problem of which relevant error possibilities could be “properly ignored” (David Lewis 1996). For instance, while making plans for the following weekend one might assert “the meteor will not hit us tomorrow” referring to the 99942 Apophis with 1 to 150k odds of impact, or noticing the winter coat of one’s partner, assert that they are back from work. The asserter in none of these cases can be ascribed knowledge, but there is a clear intuitive sense these were reasonable beliefs, assertions of which were proper. One conclusion to draw from this is that KNA is too demanding and the knowledge norm is an unrealistic and incorrect stipulation on assertions. In addition, it appears in these examples, the norm of assertion tracked reasonable beliefs. On the other hand, as noted in the previous section, defenders of KNA stand their ground, and make the argument that such asserters enjoy secondary propriety in accordance with KNA. 

KNA secondary propriety has speakers believing that they know what they assert. But what notion of “know” do ordinary speakers carry? What conditions do they think apply to “knowing”? People often use the phrase “I knew that all along “, in an ad hoc way to refer to some fact they had a hunch on. Utterances starting with the form “As far as I know”, actually have the implicature that one does not know and that it might be advisable to corroborate this information with others. People often change their minds, after exclaiming that they “knew”. Also, retracting or modifying the content of one’s assertions is not an uncommon practice. In fact, if norms of assertions were tracking knowledge in the primary or secondary sense, the practice of retracting assertions is hard to explain. If norms were tracking reasons, and it turns out our reasons were not good enough, one is allowed to change one’s mind, as tracking reasons affords defeasibility. But this is not allowed for knowledge. Clearly there seems to be some daylight between the notion and conditions of “knowing” that epistemologists assume and those that ordinary speakers hold. If anything, ordinary usage of “know” appears to be more akin to reasonably held belief. This can also be seen in the question “How do you know that?” often made in response to assertions. The expected reply here is usually to provide reasons for believing the proposition in question. And this is also what the questioner expects. In asking this question neither party expects a discussion of explicating epistemic conditions for knowledge and how they were satisfied. If determining knowledge is required, it seems too demanding and an unrealistic requirement in the space of everyday practice of assertion.

More on this point, consider buying car rental insurance in Iceland, and after evaluating the situation, asserting “wind protection is the insurance to get in Iceland”. Unlike most other places, it might be reasonable to get wind protection in Iceland, but it is reasonable only after taking into account the cost of it, odds of damage from wind (if your itinerary does not include off-road trips, the odds are extremely low), and the cost of payment to the rental company if damage from wind occurs. Alternatively, if the cost of insurance is very high, while the odds of damage ( given weather forecast and itinerary ) are very low and repairs from wind damage are also nominal, it might make more sense to not get wind protection. The crux of the matter is that the assertion is grounded in the belief that getting wind protection is the reasonable thing to do and one can offer good reasons for it. Clearly one does not speak from a position of knowing, and in fact one recognizes that one does not know that wind protection is the insurance to get (consider when one finds only slightly better reasons for it), just that it is the reasonable thing to do.

To conclude it doesn't appear to be the case ( at least not always) that speakers asserting their justified beliefs, believe that they know what they assert, at least not in the manner philosophers and defenders of KNA would have us consider “knowing”. Instead, it appears speakers simply believe they are conforming to good reasons for what they assert.  

[In another post](https://perrin-ay.github.io/epistemology/2021/01/30/An-alternative-proposal-to-the-knowledge-account-of-assertion.html){:target="_blank"} I argue for norms tracking "good reasons" and offer an alternative proposal that is hearer sensitive.
