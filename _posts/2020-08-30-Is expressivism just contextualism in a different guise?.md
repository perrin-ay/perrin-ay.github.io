I'm left wondering whether there really is that much epistemic distance between contextualism and Chrismans formulation of epistemic expressivism.
Formulation of Chrismans epistemic expressivism goes like

1) S knows that P
2) S is entitled by norms ‘e’ to her true belief that P

As I understand it, this benefits the attributor with the second condition of accepting a particular set of epistemic norms in context to the subject's circumstance. And so we have the two axis move with expressivism, 1) what are acceptable epistemic norms 2) Whether such acceptable epistemic norms then validate or invalidate (1)

In comparison, contextualism is formulated as 

1) S knows that P
2) S’s true belief that P meets epistemic standard ‘e’.

I take it that the epistemic standard could be taken to refer to epistemic justification and justification can take the form of epistemic virtues or intellectual virtues, or epistemic norms - like process reliabilism , epistemic humility , falsification etc. As Pritchard put it in our first couple of lectures, internalist conditions for knowledge could comprise of intellectual virtues - a conscientious evaluation of evidence. 

So presumably (2) can reformulated as 

*2) S’s true belief that P meets epistemic justification viz. epistemic virtues viz. epistemic norms.

Which now looks very much like (2) of epistemic expressivism except it still might not benefit from the second axis of “ what are acceptable epistemic norms” as in the case of expressivism  as expressivism treats instances of knowledge ascriptions as expressions of mental states of epistemic norm-acceptance. As I understand this -  within different contexts of the subject's utterances of (1), there could be different norms ( epistemic) accepted by different speakers. This is in opposition to Chrismans account of the contextualist view where the truth condition moves with context. 

From here, it's not very clear to me , but I believe he is alluding to one of two things ( or maybe both) 

a) Truth condition moves with context. But as I wrote earlier , the truth condition is the epistemic standard which is epistemic justification which is epistemic norms which delivers us to epistemic norms moving with context.
b) In cross context situations, epistemic norms are selected by attributors of knowledge, pro tanto - two different attributors could possibly select different sets of norms for the same context where such flexibility is not afforded to the contextualist as she is only concerned with varying truth conditions in varying contexts. The implication is here is a particular truth conditions obtains for a particular context and that particular truth condition only implies a particular epistemic standard or norm , with the effect that two different speaker could not possibly have different epistemic norms for the same context under contextualism

For the sake of completion I added (a), but i believe (b) is the claim Chrisman makes , buttressing on descriptive vs normative/nondescriptive.

If this indeed is an accurate representation of Chrismans thesis in gist , the charge on contextualism of strict adherence to the same particular set of epistemic norms in a particular context for every speaker appears a much restricted reading of contextualism , than I found it to be the case. I don't see why varying over truth conditions for knowledge attributions , where truth conditions supervene on epistemic justification or epistemic norms make an obvious case for some agreed upon universal/realist set of epistemic norms or standard. It appears to me that  it is implicit in the contextualist argument that justification to satisfy some truth condition of knowledge attribution might vary with speakers, after all justification itself is evaluative ( we have already seen in previous weeks various truth conditions criterias). 

As reference one might consider David Lewis Elusive Knowledge ( David Lewis 1996), where he details contextualism and proposes sotto voce proviso’s as plausible rules to abide when working in different contexts for knowledge attribution( we could treat these rules to give rise to epistemic norms, Lewis explicitly stays away from ‘justification’ as  an epistemic condition), but different interpretation, combinations and treatment of these rules might give to different sets of norms for the same context (in Lewis’s terms epistemic possibilities one cannot ignore), my point being that even  contextualism appears to allow for different epistemic norms that could legitimately surface for different attributors given same epistemic context.
