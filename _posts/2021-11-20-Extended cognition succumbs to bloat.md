### Introduction
Clark and Chalmers (Clark & Chalmers, 1998) introduce the notion of cognitive processes extending out of our heads and into the world. 
In this entry, I will explain the notion of extended cognition as introduced by Clark & Chalmers (henceforth C&C). 
I will talk about how C&C ground their thesis on the parity principle which is committed to a Martian saving coarse-grained functionalism. 
And how this functionalist stance is ultimately doomed and licenses cognitive bloat.

[Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/mind/2021/12/01/Extended-cognition-without-cognitive-bloat.html){:target="_blank"} I propose an alternative view that utilizes modeling extended cognition as nonlinear dynamical systems, where I discuss interactive-dominant dynamics and circular causality of components that are salient to Nonlinear dynamical systems and how these can be applied to make a positive case for extended cognition systems that does not succumb to cognitive bloat.

### Extended cognition and the parity principle

The extended cognition (henceforth EXT) makes the claim that under certain conditions, cognitive process may extend into the world i.e., extends beyond the head and into the external world. C&C deploy the parity principle to ground their EXT claims. During a cognitive task, if the human organism is engaged in two-way interactions with parts of the external world, then the external processes that exist between organism and world, and the internal processes inside the head, are bi-directionally linked to each other and create a coupled cognitive system. “In these cases, the human organism is linked with an external entity in a two-way interaction creating a coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right” (ibid.). And according to the parity principle, if the external process of this coupled cognitive system is functionally like processes that occur inside the head (that are undisputedly taken as cognitive), then the external process is a constitutive part of the agent’s cognitive process. “If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, were it done in the head, we would have no hesitation in recognizing it as part of the cognitive process, then that part of the world is part of the cognitive process” (ibid.). 

Deploying the parity principle, C&C want to draw attention to the functional role of the external process and argue that if it’s functionally similar to internal neural processes, then it should be accepted as a cognitive process. In other words, the functional role of the process should determine whether it's cognitive or not, and its external location should not be a factor in deciding its cognitive status.

### Mark of the cognitive 
The mark of the cognitive is the criterion to be met by external/non-neural processes or states to be considered cognitive. The parity principle that C&C use to make the argument for EXT assumes functionalism as its mark of the cognitive and thus connects EXT to functionalism. Functionalism states that cognitive states and processes are solely constituted by their causal functional roles and not their underlying material substrates (Block 2007). It makes the case for multiple realizability (Block & Fodor 1980) and provides a principled basis to grant mental states and processes to creatures like Martians whose physical makeup might be completely different from ours. Drawing on functionalism and multiple realizability, the parity principle identifies external processes between the organism and non-organic external world structures that exhibit functional parity, as cognitive.

For example, consider the use of pen and paper to solve a long mathematical proof. For most people, such a cognitive task is not performed solely in the mind. One usually starts with externalizing on paper the initial conditions and axioms of the proof. As the proof develops over time, the process of externalizing on paper the intermediate (and unfolding) stages of the proof functions as writing to a working memory space. The parity principle would contend that since the external process between agent with pen and paper plays the functional role of biological working memory, cognition extends to the pen and paper.

#### Coarse-grained functionalism 
Rupert endorses functionalism but argues that the extended cognitive processes legitimized by extended cognition are not functionally similar to internal processes of the brain (Rupert 2004). What underwrites his argument are the fine-grained differences between the functional profiles of extended and internal processes (Sprevak 2009). By highlighting such differences, he argues that extended processes do not meet the bar for functional similarity, and this invalidates the functional parity move of C&C to grant it cognitive status.

But the bar for functional similarity is an important parameter to consider when endorsing a particular functionalist account. Raise the bar too high and we end up such fine-grained functional comparisons that would withhold cognition from creatures such as Martians. For instance, Rupert provides an account of ‘negative transfer’ found in human biological memory (Rupert 2004) but absent in extended memory (for example my earlier case of pen and paper) and concludes that extended memory is not sufficiently similar in function to bio-memory. But one can imagine Martians whose internal memory does not exhibit this phenomenon either, then Rupert’s argument against extended memory would also deny memory to Martians. 

Sprevak (Sprevak 2009) contends Rupert raises the bar for functional similarity too high. Raising the bar this high leads to such fine-grained functional comparisons, which not only deny extended cognitive processes, but also cognitive Martians. When forwarding functionalist accounts, we want them to protect Martians from being denied cognition.” Functionalism was in part designed to avoid necessarily withholding mentality from creatures with a different fine-grained makeup” (ibid.). Sprevak argues that the Martian intuition and EXT in fact covary with the level of grain selection. Meaning if the grain is coarse enough to allow for cognitive Martians, it usually allows for EXT. On the other hand, if grain is so fine, where it denies EXT, it denies cognitive Martians as well. Since we want our functionalist accounts to conserve the Martian intuition, the parity principle must be committed to a coarse-grained functionalist account that is coarse enough to grant Martian’s cognition. And this would also serve as the basis to reject Rupert’s fine-grained functional dissimilarity argument between extended processes and internal ones. 

But in the next section I will argue how taking the Martian intuition saving, coarse-grained functionalist account licenses cognitive bloat. 

### Cognitive bloat
The argument for cognitive bloat can be formalized as follows:

1) The argument for EXT is grounded in the parity principle

2) The parity principle takes functional similarity as the mark of the cognitive for external processes.

3) The functionalist account assumed in the parity principle needs to be committed to a coarse-grained level that conserves the Martian intuition which then also protects EXT from fine-grained functional comparison attacks. 

4) But #3 turns out to be too permissive and licenses runaway instances of cognition extending into the world, which intuitively seem wild and implausible. This is cognitive bloat. 

For instance, according to #3, simply having reliable access to a cellphone which contains a phonebook, grants the agent the extended cognitive process of phone directory service to search and access thousands of phone numbers, even when the agent has never searched for a number in that phonebook. This is because one can always imagine a Martian internal cognitive economy with a process that is functionally like the agent’s extended cognitive process in question. Suppose the Martian has memory banks that can accommodate large stores of phone numbers. Suppose these are akin to non-occurrent beliefs tucked away until they need consultation. We can even suppose that the Martian is unaware she has these “phonebook memories”, but these “phonebook memories'' can be triggered when someone asks her about them. Suppose the internal cognitive process that accesses these phone numbers produces a distinct phenomenology akin to the visual perception of searching for phone numbers on one’s phone and so on. 

The problem with committing to a functionalist account that is Martian intuition saving coarse-grained, is that it leaves the door open to conjure up a Martian with internal cognitive processes that can made functionally similar to intuitively implausible accounts of extended processes. And so, I argue that the cognitive bloat problems that plague EXT clearly reside with this mark of the cognitive that the parity principle is committed to, and EXT succumbs to cognitive bloat under this view.

This completes my discussions on the problem of cognitive bloat in extended cognition that is based on C&C’s parity principle. [Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/mind/2021/12/01/Extended-cognition-without-cognitive-bloat.html){:target="_blank"} I argue for an alternative view on the mark of the cognitive that utilizes dynamical systems theory.
