## What was Hume really on about?

References Hume’s philosophical works and ideas might suggest that his main interest was epistemological i.e. knowledge and its justification. However, first and foremost, Hume considered himself a scientist of the mind and his primary concern was more genetic than epistemic i.e. in how it is we get to believe what we do, than whether said belief is justified or valid.

First person introspection reveals our mind is populated with beliefs (amongst other things), and Hume’s interest, in the first case was in understanding what beliefs are and how the mind comes to be populated with them. We are not born with beliefs already lodged in the mind, so there must be some mechanisms by which they are formed.

For instance, a Hume’s discussion of demonstrative reasoning, if it were to serve the ‘genetic’ purpose, then these discussions must not ignore the question of how knowledge comes about i.e. it must include an explanation on the process that produces it. It is owing to his genetic agenda that Hume conceives of demonstrative reasoning separate from deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning takes knowledge as input ( true premises) and enjoins a necessary conclusion, yielding knowledge as output. However, this does not explain how knowledge arises tout court , but explains how to gain more knowledge starting from an epistemic and knowledgeable position. On the other hand, in demonstrative reasoning Hume wants to conceptualize knowledge , how is it that we come to know, when we start more fundamental and not knowledge based mental objects which he calls ideas.
