[Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/epistemology/2022/12/02/Bayesian-accounts-of-explanatory-power.html){:target="_blank"}, I had introduced explanatory reasoning and explanatory power (EP). I went on to discuss Peirce’s three step inferential pattern (PI) that captures an intuitive sense in which we evaluate EP. I also covered Schupbach and Sprenger’s (S&S’s) proposal which offers a Bayesian approach to accounting EP in the context of PI.
