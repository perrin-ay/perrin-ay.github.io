### Thought experiments (TE) are an essential tool in a philosophers tool box

Thought experiments take a particular state of affairs( these could be and mostly are non-actual situations) and invites reasoners and readers to make judgements about it. These judgements can provide us with new knowledge.I take this definition of a thought experiment, adapted from Gendler( Gendler 1998), as an uncontroversial one. Since these judgements are treated as new knowledge , the outcome of a thought experiment is taken to provide evidence for particular facts about the world. The same outcome can then also serve as  justified premise for further philosophical arguments ( which could themselves be thought experiments). In this way, thought experiments have been crucial for the growth of philosophical knowledge and advance of philosophical theories and concepts.To be clear, knowledge gained via thought experiments is not strictly limited to some new fact learned about the world.Thought experiments can be used to show contradictions in existing philosophical concepts or cast supporting evidence for others. They can be used to illustrate how a theory would apply to particular case, and appeal to readers intuitions to get the point across when used as a pedagogical tool by illustrating otherwise dense and abstract theories. **As long as the outcome of a thought experiment evokes a new or a change in propositional attitude in readers and reasoners, it can be said to have constituted a new belief, which could constitute new knowledge**. 

However the epistemic origin of these judgments is often unclear. In a thought experiment we ostensibly begin from a position of ignorance , sit and contemplate, and arrive at new knowledge about the world, without having conducted any real experiments or collected new empirical data.  This poses the question of where this new knowledge comes from, and whether these judgments are justified. To put it in a more general form - *”how any non perceptual capacity can lead to new knowledge”*(Gendler 2004).

### Phenomenological character of TE

The character of conducting a thought experiment is often easy, where we imagine a situation unfolding in our minds eye. It is uncontroversial to say mental imagery is salient to thought experiments and is usually accompanied with some manipulation of that mental image during the course of the thought experiment. The phenomenology is effortless, arriving at outcomes is quick, with reasoner’s of the thought experiment often reaching the same conclusion. Conducting a thought experiment does not feel as if one is engaged in purposeful or explicitly driven inductive or deductive inference from propped up premises. On the other hand, it does have a feel of imagistic reasoning- propping up of a mental image and manipulating that image,accompanied with intuitive logical inference to yield judgements.

### Scientific TE vs Philsophical TE

While there have been many accounts of scientific thought experiments , there is a paucity of contribution to accounts of philosophical thought experiments. At its core, there are disagreements whether scientific and philosophical thought experiments are of a kind , Wilkes believes they aren’t, while Sorenson believes they are ( Wilkes 1988 and Sorenson 1992). 

Still, it is uncontroversial to say philosophical thought experiments and scientific thought experiments (and scientific experiments) share common features, insofar as they share certain methodological and logical requirements such as 
1. controlled and consistent manipulation of data in the environment of the experiment,
2. establishing  dependence or relation of monitored variables to one another, and
3. dependence on background experience (assumptions, hypotheses, beliefs and theories) to conduct and evaluate the experiment.

Where scientific thought experiments work on scientific laws in counterfactual imaginative scenarios, philosophical thought experiments do the same thing but on philosophical concepts.
