[Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/epistemology/2020/12/16/The-knowledge-account-of-assertion.html){:target="_blank"}, I explored the knowledge account of assertion (KNA) and its shortcomings, particularly challenging its overriding-norms and secondary propriety maneuvers. In the following post i present an alternative proposal to KNA that is hearer sensitive and tracks good reasons.

## An Alternative proposal

The intuition KNA draws on is that one finds asserters representing themselves as knowing what they assert, and to be criticized when they assert something they don't know. But consider some everyday scenarios where this intuition does not obtain.

*Radio DJ* asserts “Everybody loves Harry Styles new album!”. It seems odd to think of the DJ as representing herself to be knowing this, or for me to impute knowledge of this proposition on to her. But nevertheless, one finds her assertion appropriate if she had good reasons for it, like audience feedback and scores. 

In *philosophical papers*, we often assert things we don't know, but have good reasons to support the claims. And sometimes we *don't even believe (and knowledge requires belief)* assertions we make for which we have rational support , for example one might assert Nick Bostrom Simulation Theory (Bostrom 2003) and forward strong mathematical reasons for it, but not come to believe one is living in a simulation. Again, we find the norm of assertions to track reasons or rational support, whereas KNA would need the overruling norms of professional contexts to explain the propriety of such assertion.

When *planning on a picnic*, one might assert “It will not rain tomorrow”. Clearly the asserter doesn't know this, the assertion was based on a forecast of probabilistic weather modeling. But there is an intuitive sense the assertion is proper. When questioned about her assertion, a response that the forecast predicted no precipitation, suffices as good reasons and judges the assertion appropriate. If it turns out that the picnic got rained out, given that the assertion was based on good reasons, one finds no reason to criticize the asserter for the falsity of her assertion. Whereas KNA would demand truth for assertion to be proper. Now if the reasons for asserting had been based on tarot-card readings, then regardless of falsity or truth, one finds the asserter inculpate of criticism and her assertion inappropriate, showing norms of assertion sensitive to good and bad reasons. 

I will use the following vignette to finalize my formulation on the norms of assertion. Lopen believes walking under a ladder brings terrible luck and avoids doing so, sometimes at great inconvenience. But he doesn't go about asserting this belief “Walk under the ladder and suffer grave consequences” to people, and I think there is a sense one can see this applies to many of our irrational beliefs which one recognizes to be irrational. So here we have a clear case of what looks like a norm that dictates which beliefs should be asserted and the answer appears to be ones for which we can offer rational support. But suppose Lopen attends a colloquium for the supernatural, and finding himself in a seminar on superstitions, asserts his ladder beliefs, which are well received. So, what changed? His audience did, to whom he thinks he can now offer reasons that suffices for good enough reasons to assert. 


**Norm of Good Reasons (NGR)**: Assert only when you can offer good reasons for your audience.


One final note on this vignette. If Lopen, walks into a rationality convention, where he is offered rationally grounded assertions that go against his ladder-belief, he might find these assertions appropriate as they were offered with good arguments and reasons, but it still might not change his belief regarding ladders. KNA would find this hard to explain, since from the hearer’s perspective, an assertion is found appropriate when the asserter is ascribed with knowledge. But it seems implausible that one considers a proposition suffices for knowledge and still fails to install corresponding belief. 

Here is a brief explanation on what I consider to constitute ‘good reasons’ in my formulation. Under Schroeder’s encroachment views (Schroeder 2011) doxastic states of withholding belief can occur when one expects further information is imminent, or when stakes are high. These non-epistemic factors raise the bar on sufficiency of evidence, and only upon meeting this raised level of evidence does one have good reasons for belief. Essentially what suffices for evidence and constitutes good reasons is sensitive to pragmatic and moral factors (Basu and Schroeder 2019)

Lottery and Moorean assertions are forwarded as evidence for the knowledge norm. The assertion “your ticket is a loser” is inappropriate and can be explained by KNA as one does not know the ticket is a loser even if one might have rational support in believing so. But contrast this with the analogous (and with better odds) meteor-assertion from section 2 which seems appropriate.  However, applying KNA to the meteor-assertion would deem it inappropriate and that seems wrong. I think a better explanation for the lottery assertion, consistent with NGR, is Lottie having purchased a ticket takes the attitude of withholding belief that her ticket will lose, expecting further information to be forthcoming - this would be the lottery results. In doing so, the bar of sufficiency for evidence that constitutes good reason for the belief that her ticket is a loser is raised. Note the formulation of NGR is audience sensitive i.e. what constitutes as good reasons for one hearer might not for another.  So then being told flat out her ticket will lose is inappropriate as from her perspective it does not offer good reasons (and I suspect what would constitute good reasons for Lottie are the lottery results itself). To a third-party Sam, who does not play the lottery, the assertion “Lottie’s ticket will lose”, might not be found inappropriate, but KNA would have the same assertion improper for all hearers.

Moorean assertions could also be explained with NGR’s audience sensitivity in mind.
Asserting the Moorean paradox “p but I don't believe p”, in ordinary conversation is confusing and does not represent oneself as having good reasons for saying this in the eyes of everyday audience and so NGR rightly deems it inappropriate. But consider if Lopen from the ladder example asserts “Walking under the ladder is safe , but I don't believe walking under the ladder is safe” to Tamar Gendler ( See Alief’s, Gendler 2008), she, I suspect will not find this assertion inappropriate. Similarly if I were to assert “p, but I don't know p” at my epistemology study group, I surmise my audience will not find it improper, as in their eyes I’m representing myself as having good reasons for saying so , perhaps invoking radical skepticism, whereas my co-workers in IT might as there are no good reasons to assert such a thing to them. It appears NGR explains the Moorean absurdity.
