Beliefs are how we think of each other, they underpin our relations and whilst remaining private, they can still harm. When it comes to family and friends, we hold each other to a set of belief-based-expectations and when those are not met it serves as grounds for feeling wronged. In this essay I want to show how in using stereotypes, wronging tracks on belief, as it takes away personhood and autonomy. I suggest that ‘theory of mind’ also plays a role in feeling wronged. And in unpacking the challenge from control I suggest nurturing epistemic virtues exerts control over beliefs.

### Private Beliefs

Consider the following vignette: Logain ,Jur, and Alivia are part of the same team and closely work together .Unbeknownst to Logain, his colleagues frequently ridicule, and talk of him in demeaning ways. All the while their outward behavior to Logain’s face remains cordial. To the point where if one were to ask Logain how his relations with colleagues were, he would say it was pleasant and collegial. But do we get the sense their relationship tracks on mutual collegial regard ? Is Logain treated fairly by his coworkers? This picture tells of a relationship where Logain's colleagues think of him in hurtful ways, whereas Logain, unaware of this ( on account of his coworkers collegial outward behavior to his face), strives to offer a friendly and collaborative relationship to them as one expected in such relations. *The pleasant outward behavior of his colleagues ( while snickering behind his back) does little to dismantle the sense of Logain being wronged, perhaps even adds an insidious complexion to the matter on account of certain deceit (Nagel 1970 makes similar appeal to wronging committed to the deceased)*. 

Suppose a confidant of Logains overhears the coworkers tete-a-tete gleefully belittling Logain and informs him of what his colleagues really think of him. This is tantamount, mutatis mutandis, to Logain happening upon a journal of one of his colleague. Both the overheard conversation and the journal entry affords a view inside the colleague’s mind, and what she believed of Logain. So while there are no tangible manifestations of their hurtful doxastic attitudes in their actions to Logains face, yet Logain is now cognizant of their beliefs, and there is a poignant sense that he is bound to feel hurt by his coworkers.

It is natural to consider how we treat others in action is what wrongs them. But as people we seem to deeply care what other people think of us and not just how they act towards us. We maintain certain normative expectations of others beliefs of us. These expectations tend to be a function of the relationship, and grounded in believing certain things of us that we deem appropriate, and fair in context of the relationship. 

**When these expectations are not met, it evokes reactions that constitute wronging**. Beliefs are private things, but they stand in causal relation to actions. Actions are a ipso-facto consequence of beliefs and when one finds actions culpable of wronging, it follows one finds the antecedent beliefs inculpate. Logains colleagues' true beliefs remained private in the first instance ( before finding the journal), however both instances of before and after the journal discovery draws out intuitions that Logain was wronged by his colleagues. And this is because regardless of action, beliefs are constitutive of our interpersonal relations. Beliefs and what we think of each other affect and apply pressure on relationships and what others think of us has reputational implications, and implications on the cooperative and collaborative endeavours. One can envisage how the coworkers beliefs about Logain engender a reputational cost and damage the cooperative tasks they might undertake together. And after discovering the journal, Logains sense of wronging is grounded purely on belief and not actions of the coworkers.

### Family and Friends

Naturally relationships with family and friends are different from those of colleagues or coworkers. And with that, the expectations on the beliefs they hold of us are different too. Consider the following sketch: Toman’s cousin Rand has a history of shoplifting as a repeat offender. After much intervention, Rand vows to never shoplift again. While exiting a store Rand’s shopping bag is found to contain a number of items with the RFIDs still attached. Toman falsely believes Rand is shoplifting again. Later, the attendant clarifies it was a mistake and confirms those items were paid for.

Suppose Rand comes to learn of Toman’s belief. One can imagine Rand reacting with hurt and disappointment, after all he had made a promise, and even going to programs to help him not succumbing to recidivism. Toman could say he was rationally justified in his belief, Rand does have a history, and there was evidence of items with RFIDs. But does this quell the sense of disappointment Rand might feel? Does he not feel wronged because his cousin's beliefs were grounded in rational justification ? Friends and family naturally expect more from us and our beliefs. The normative standards are higher- we ought to think well of them,  we ought to have more faith in them and we ought to give them the benefit of the doubt. Family and friends are said to be crucial to a good life and contribute in flourishing and well being, and for all these reasons we are and expected to be partial to them. And one could say Toman ought to have withheld judgement , ought to have sought more evidence, and given Rand the benefit of doubt as this is what is expected of family and friends. When these expectations of belief were not met, Rand was entitled to feel hurt.
