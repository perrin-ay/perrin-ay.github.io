Here , I had introduced explanatory reasoning and explanatory power (EP). I went on to discuss Peirce’s three step inferential pattern (PI) that captures an intuitive sense in which we evaluate EP. I also covered Schupbach and Sprenger’s (S&S’s) proposal which offers a Bayesian approach to accounting EP in the context of PI.

In this article I explore the role of surprise in EP within the inferential framework of PI.This is a natural starting point since the inferential pattern of PI gets off the ground with surprise. Following this I pose my argument against S&S’s proposal, exposing the fact that degrees of belief in explanandum (E) are already equal to 1 once the agent encounters E. This undermines S&S’s account since they build on the assumption that the reduction in surprise is directly correlated to increasing degrees of belief in E.
