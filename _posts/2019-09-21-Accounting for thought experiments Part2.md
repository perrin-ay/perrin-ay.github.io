[In part 1](https://perrin-ay.github.io/thought-experiments/2019/09/12/Accounting-for-thought-experiments.html){:target="_blank"}, I introduced thought experiments , what they are , their usefulness to philosophers, their phenomenonal character and how philosophical thought experiments might differ from scientific ones. Here I will quickly run through the two primary accounts for philosophical thought experiments.

### Nortons Account

Nortons account claims that thought experiments are nothing but picturesque arguments and that the picturesque character can be expunged without suffering any loss to its epistemic force. Norton writes , since the thought experimenter is not exposed to any new sense experiences and experimental data during the course of thought experiment , the experimenter either re-organizes or generalizes what she already knows,  leading to deductive or inductive form of arguments respectively. The epistemological question concerning the origin of new knowledge is then answered in Nortons account by referring to the use of standard epistemic resources- ordinary sense experiences and inferences we draw from them.(Norton 1996).

#### Shortcomings

Norton’s view does not provide an adequate account for the typical phenomenology associated when conducting a thought experiment. As noted in section 1, the process of thought experiments is often characterized by being cognitively easy , the feeling of a situation unfolding in your mind’s eye, and no explicit propping up of premises on which rigourous modes of inferences are made. Norton’s view purports conducting a thought experiment is simply an execution of an argument. Norton additionally makes the strong claim that “workings and achievement of thought experiments can be revealed and fully captured in explicit argument” ( Norton 1996). But conducting a deductive or inductive logical argument has a markedly different cognitive feel to it, and is unlike that which is often salient to conducting a thought experiment.

Norton does satisfactorily show that a number of thought experiments in science can be reconstructed in the form of arguments by making premises and propositions explicit. These arguments thus framed are then shown to deductively or inductively arrive at the same conclusion as the outcome of the thought experiment. But there are thought experiments(in science and philosophy) that do not have any argument form at all, and remain irreducible to arguments. Consider thought experiments that involve imagining qualia.  Taking the example of Hume’s missing shade of  blue, the conduct of the thought experiment would go something along the lines of imagining a color chart with shades of the color spectrum and a gap where the shade of blue would fit and then we imagine the missing shade (considering the imagined spectrum of colors to the left and right of the gap) ( Hume 1978 and Cooper 2005). Additionally, other thought experiments involving spatial reasoning like the judgement elicited from thought experiment of whether a square peg will fit through a round hole of same diameter ( Cooper 2005) or the thought experiment of whether some number of elephants will fit in your living room (Gendler 2004), elicit judgment but have no argumentational form to them.

### Browns Account

Central to Browns account is a special class of thought experiments which he claims to be both destructive-destroys or at least presents a serious problem for a theory, and constructive - advances the theory in such a way that it is better than its predecessor. He calls these platonic thought experiments, during the course of which reasoners gain access to the platonic realm where real existence of laws of nature resides, and further, perceiving these laws of nature bestows experimenter with epistemic gains. Under this platonic and realist account of the laws of nature , the knowledge gained from thought experiments is a priori - not based on any new empirical data or any inferential methods( Brown 1991b).

To better discuss Browns account and his intended appeal to platonic intuitions, Browns canonical example of Galileo’s falling stones,  needs to be reviewed. In the Discorsi , Galileo spokesman Salviati seeks to refute the Aristotelian view of speed proportional to the weight of a falling stone and comes up with the following thought experiment. Starting with the assumption, stone A which is 10 times heavier than B will fall 10 times faster than B, he goes on to show this leads to paradoxical results: if we combine A and B , then B should slow stone A down, and this combined stone body of A+B would be slower than A. On the other hand , combined A+B is heavier than A and should fall faster than A. Ergo, the Aristotelian view leads to paradoxical results ,and thereby the view is destroyed. After which, Brown remarks the right answer is plain as day and immediately grasped, thereby constructing a new theory, that all stones fall alike. 

In Brown’s account of the falling stones thought experiment, it is what follows after destroying the Aristotelian view and in constructing a new theory that has the platonic character. The point Brown tries to make, is that Galileo need not have reached the conclusion of all stones fall alike. Showing that heavy stones do not fall faster than lighter stones can be found to hold with a reasonable number of other theories, such as that different shaped stones fall at different rates , or that different chemical composition of stones govern the rates at which they fall etc. The crucial( platonic) step, according to Brown happens with Galileo's ease and success in picking the right theory immediately , and also arriving at a conclusion which is common among reasoners and readers conducting  this thought experiment, and this in Brown’s account can only be accounted by platonic intuitions.

#### Shortcomings

Brown’s jump to the mysterious platonic realm to explain the falling stones conclusion is unnecessary. An appeal to inferences from personal experience and background knowledge (assumptions and intuitions) could adequately be made to draw the same conclusions (Norton 1996 , Clatterbuck 2013, Cooper 2005 , Gendler 2004 and Brendel 2004, all make the same point). Along with the benefit of considerable philosophical and experimental studies on inferences made from  background knowledge, it has the added virtue of parsimony ( Norton 1996 and Clatterbuck 2013 make this point as well)

The mysterious nature of the platonic account also gives it a dubious and unintelligible flavor. The act of Platonic perception itself is not explained by Brown, and there is no model issued on how during the course of thought experiments, one reaches into the platonic realm. There is no account of how these platonic insights are perceived. Admitting to the platonic view would mean making an additional ontological commitment to the existence of the platonic realm where real laws of nature reside. Furthermore, the link from thought experiments to platonic access is itself puzzling, if the existence and access to such a platonic realm is assumed, why would there be any need to even run thought experiments ( Brown mentions thought experiments serve as vehicles to access the platonic realm, but besides this remark , the workings of gaining platonic intuitions remains vague and unclear).
