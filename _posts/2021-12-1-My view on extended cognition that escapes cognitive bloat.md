### Introduction
Clark and Chalmers (Clark & Chalmers, 1998) introduced the notion of cognitive processes extending out of our heads and into the world.  
[Here](https://perrin-ay.github.io/mind/2021/11/20/Extended-cognition-succumbs-to-bloat.html){:target="_blank"} I talked about how Clark and Chalmers (C&C) ground their thesis on the parity principle which is committed to a Martian saving coarse-grained functionalism. And how this functionalist stance is ultimately doomed and licenses cognitive bloat.

In this post I propose an alternative view that utilizes modeling extended cognition as nonlinear dynamical systems, where I discuss interactive-dominant dynamics and circular causality of components that are salient to Nonlinear dynamical systems and how these can be applied to make a positive case for extended cognition systems that does not succumb to cognitive bloat.

### Dynamical cognitive system

Dynamic systems are those that evolve and change over time. Dynamical systems theory (DST) provides the necessary tools - ordinary differential equations and state-space plots, to evaluate and model such systems (Strogatz 2015). Here I discuss nonlinear dynamical systems whose properties are conducive to modeling organism-environment interactions during cognitive tasks. And I will go on to show how genuine cases of extended cognition are explained by nonlinear dynamics and the mark of the cognitive that this deliver’s is not plagued by cognitive bloat. 

#### Nonlinear dynamical system
Dynamic systems may behave linearly or nonlinearly. Nonlinearity ensues when the components of the system are interdependent and circularly interactive, resulting in system-level outputs that are exponential or multiplicative rather than proportional to its inputs (Enns 2010). Nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS) exhibit interaction-dominant dynamics, since it is not the additive and linear sum of individual component processes, but the continual circular interactions of components as a whole that gives rise to system-level dynamics (behavior over time). In contrast, components in linear dynamical systems (LDS) are relatively independent (not interdependent), having negligible-to-no circular interactions and acting only in an additive relationship to each other. LDS exhibit component-dominant dynamics, where the output is proportional to its input, since the output is the additive and linear sum of individual component dynamics (Holden et al., 2009).

A consequence of nonlinearity is that effects of change or variance in behavior (component-level or system-level) will not remain localized but will ramify and spread throughout the system due to its interaction-dominant nature. And so, any observable change or variance in a nonlinear dynamic system (whose state continuously changes and evolves over time), cannot be analyzed into well-defined sources of change. Hence it is not possible to identify and attribute individual components as the sources of the system variance or the sources of the evolving system behavior (Wallot, & Kelty-Stephen 2017). This implicates NLDS system-level dynamics as non-decomposable into individual component dynamics. That is, its system-level macro dynamics (behavior evolving over time) simultaneously emerges from its strongly interdependent and circularly interactive component dynamics (Kelso 1995)

To conclude of this subsection, what are salient to NLDS is:

1. Interactive-dominant dynamics.
2. Non-decomposability of system-level dynamics to individual component-level dynamics.
   
#### Cognitive systems
Cognitive and psychological sciences have increasingly employed DST to model and measure cognitive processes revealed by bodily movements and interactions with the environment. For instance, in child psychology (Thelen & Smith 1993), human decision-making (van Rooij, Favela, Malone, & Richardson 2013), body and world (Chemero 2009), vision cognition (Stephen, & Mirman 2010), and social psychology (Richardson, & Marsh 2014). 

Since central to the extended cognition thesis are organism-environment interaction dynamics (interactions occur over time and thus have a temporal component), DST can be used to assess and model such systems. EXT makes claims of extended cognition under conditions of “two-way interactions” between organism and environment (C&C 1998), which Clark later elaborated as continuous reciprocal causation, where components of the system are continuously affecting other components and simultaneously being affected by them (Clark 2008). As noted in section 3.1, interaction-dominant systems where components are circularly interactive are saliencies of nonlinear dynamical behavior and so NLDS best serves to model the extended cognitive system (Chemero 2009).

Consider the following as an illustration of what nonlinear dynamical modeling of extended cognitive systems could look like. Let's take the extended cognitive system of my earlier pen and paper example from section 2.1 as system X, that consists of components: pen and intermediate stages of a mathematical proof externalized on paper as parts of the external world as E, the human agent as H, sensory inputs as S and motor outputs of hand movement as M. Quantitatively one may represent system X with the following two coupled differential equations (idealized) where a, b, c and d are some constants:

dE/dt = aE + M*(bH) ….(a)  
dH/dt = cH+S*(dE)........(b)

dE/dt and dH/dt are derivatives over time that represent the infinitesimal changes in E and H (time as a continuous variable)

Our model X consists of two differential equations that are coupled, meaning they are circularly interactive where change to one equation will lead to changes in the other equation (this is similar to Beer 1995 coupled differential equation of a blind man and his visual substitution system), therefore system X dynamics are interactive-dominant. The sensory input S, taken from external parts of the world E (bits of externalized proof on paper), will bring about change in the agent H (further inferences to progress on the proof). A change in H would also bring about a change in motor output M in terms of handling the pen and manipulating symbols on paper, that will bring about a change in E. Change in E, brings change in S and the circular causality is continual and interactive-dominant behavior emerges for X.  As discussed in section 3.1 and emphasized in its conclusion, the two coupled differential equations cannot be solved in isolation of each other. Solving in isolation will amount to breaking the circular causality among components that gives rise to interactive-dominant system level dynamics in the first place. Since the system-level dynamics for X are “progressing/completing the mathematical proof”, removing equation (a) i.e., the environment component E, or solving equation (b) in isolation, will amount to the elimination of the system-level dynamics i.e., drop in competence and inability to make progress on the proof. In interactive-dominant NLDS, components cannot be decoupled. Isolation or removal of components eliminates system-level dynamics (Fuchs 2013). I will add this as #3 to the list of what is salient to NLDS: 3) Components cannot be decoupled or isolated. If treated in isolation, then system-level dynamics are eliminated.
   
#### Extended cognition
If organism-environment interactions to perform a cognitive task meet the conditions (circular causality in components) required to be modeled as a NLDS, then per #2 and #3 (from sections 3.1 and 3.2), the cognitive process is a system-level emergence that cannot be decomposed to individual system components, as it emerges from the whole of component-interactions and only belongs to the system whole. Furthermore, the circularly interacting components of this cognitive system are (c) internal neural processes and (d) external organism-to-environment processes, and (c) and (d) cannot be decoupled from each other or treated in isolation, without eliminating the cognitive process. Thus, the system-level dynamics that we have here is a cognitive process that extends to parts of the environment, and the circularly interactive internal and external processes are constituent parts of this cognitive process.

To summarize and conclude, during a cognitive task if organism-environment interactions meet the conditions required to be modeled as a NLDS (interactive-dominance/circular causality), then the system-level dynamics is a cognitive process that extends out to parts of the environment engaged in a circular causal coupling with the organism. Such an organism-environment cognitive system will exhibit properties that are salient to NLDS systems (#1, #2 and #3), where the resulting cognitive process is emergent from internal-external process interactions and belongs only to the system as a whole. Then the mark of the cognitive in such organism-environment cognitive systems, which are essentially extended cognitive systems, is that they be interactive-dominant where external and internal processes are circularly causal. 

This completes my discussions on extended cognitive systems modeled as NLDS and concludes with a new mark of the cognitive. In the next section I will briefly assess how this stands against some emblematic use-cases of cognitive bloat.

#### Bloat assessment
For convenience, I will refer to the circular coupling of components i.e the mark of the cognitive discussed in section 3 as markC and the functional parity mark of the cognitive discussed in section 2 as markF.  In section 2.1, I discussed how the typical extended case of pen and paper can be modeled as a NLDS and satisfies markC. Let's consider the cognitive bloat illustration from section 2.3 of the cell phone phonebook that one has never used. Unlike markF, markC does not count this as extended cognition as we don’t find this organism-phone/phonebook system as interactive-dominant where there is circular causality. Simply having reliable access to the phone/phonebook does not grant it extended cognitive status per markC. Similarly other typical bloat vignettes such as “picking up a book and coming to believe everything in it” or “possessing the cognitive process of any program in your computer” which pass markF (Sprevak 2009) would not pass markC. These would pass markF since the functional parity principle I argued for in section 2 is committed to the Martian intuition saving, coarse-grained functionalism and one could always imagine a Martian with internal cognitive processes that are functional similar- say a Martian with several innate cognitive processes (processes akin to the computer programs in one’s computer) and physical constitution that supports the algorithmic and processing requirement of running those processes. The Martian might not even be aware of these innate cognitive features and comes to know of them only when it is brought to her attention and so on.

Insofar my discussions are convincing, I have shown that extended cognition is only vulnerable to bloat when its thesis is cashed out in terms of the functional similarity. But when understood and explained as a NLDS, there can be extended cognition without bloat.
